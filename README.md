At Forma.ai, I:
- build `React` dashboards
   - so sales reps know how much they get paid and why
- write `SQL` queries from business logic
- develop on a `Django` backend to send data to the frontend

I've taken the lead in building up our company's [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) to boost dev productivity.

ğŸ’» &nbsp; I like building apps with TypeScript, React, Node.js, Python and Postgres!
